<h2>My Top 3 Movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Taxi Driver</h3>
<p>This one is my favourite. I really like the soundtrack of this movie.</p>
<h3>The Silence of the lambs</h3>
<p>Of course I like this cause of the psychological themes. </p>
<h3>Mirror</h3>
<p>I have only watched this film from the Andrei Tarkovsky collection, but it is still phenomenal.</p>
