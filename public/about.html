<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I'm a newcomer to coding and web development, striving to become a Full Stack Web Developer (that's one of my goals).</p>

<p>I'm 20 years old and I'm a brazilian fellow! 
  So, while I'm learning programming, I'm also polishing my English skills too.</p>

<p>So far(in 2025) I've learned Python, and I'm currently focusing on understanding Java and HTML.</p>
